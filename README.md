Task 3: Predictive Modeling with Decision Tree Classifier

📌 About the Task

For the third task in the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech, Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn


🔍 Workflow Summary

Dataset Preparation:

Loaded and understood dataset structure

Performed label encoding for categorical variables

Splitting data into training and test sets

Modeling with Decision Tree:

Used DecisionTreeClassifier from Scikit-learn

Tuned model parameters like max_depth and criterion

Trained the model and evaluated performance

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)


Insights Extracted:

Key features influencing purchasing decisions included age, job type, contact method, and previous campaign outcomes

Model helped identify customer segments more likely to respond positively to marketing campaigns
