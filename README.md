Task 3: Predictive Modeling with Decision Tree Classifier

📌 About the Task

For the third task in the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech, I built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service. The model is trained on the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes demographic and behavioral attributes.

This task focuses on applying supervised machine learning for binary classification using decision trees — a simple yet powerful algorithm used in many real-world applications.
